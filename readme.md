### This repository contains the final project for CS 47205 Information Security
### This repo contains part 1, in which the code is vulernable to SQL Injection

#### Note: This code purposefully contains code vulernable to SQL injection, and should not be reused outside of the context of explictly demonstrating SQL injection. 

**Reusing this code outside of this context will allow any user of this system to bypass login authentication, destroy or delete the database, and access any database table 
via UNION SELECT using common sql injection techniques easily found on Google.**
